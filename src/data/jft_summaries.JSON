  "short_summary": "My ears work fine; it's my ego that's deaf. I don’t listen — I wait for my turn to perform. Real listening isn't planning my comeback or building a TED Talk in my head while someone bleeds in front of me. When I stop rehearsing my identity and pay attention, I accidentally connect.

A winner isn't someone with a perfect life; it’s someone who keeps showing up while their life is on fire. They don’t worship personalities; they practice principles. They don’t disappear when things get hard; they tell the truth and stay clean anyway. Winning here isn’t glamorous — it’s consistency disguised as hope.",

Even now, clean, we can cling to discomfort like it's a toxic comfort blanket. The truth? No one is forcing us to stay miserable. Recovery doesn’t drag us out of pain — it hands us the door handle.

Then we realized addiction isn’t about the drug — it’s about the part of us that can turn anything into an escape. Even without substances, the same brain runs the same script: obsess, avoid, self-destruct, repeat. Drugs were just the special effects. The problem lived in us. The solution has to live in us, too — and that’s what the Twelve Steps are actually fixing.",

When I help someone newer than me, I’m not being noble—I’m protecting my own recovery. My story only becomes useless when I keep it to myself. Sharing isn’t charity; it’s maintenance.
